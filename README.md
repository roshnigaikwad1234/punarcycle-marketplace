🚀 Problem Statement

Industrial waste management today is:

Manual and broker-dependent

Expensive to dispose

Environmentally damaging

Lacking visibility of real sustainability impact

Factories often don’t know who can reuse their waste, while other factories spend extra money buying raw materials.

💡 Solution – punarCYCLE

punarCYCLE creates a digital circular economy marketplace where:

Factories list industrial waste

Other factories discover reusable materials

AI suggests best matches

Deals are initiated digitally

Environmental impact is tracked

This turns waste → resource.
